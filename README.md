# Context Free Network
Exploring the effects of context in image classification


## Instructions
1. Download the data and add it to `res/` directory. Your directory tree should look like this:
```
context-free-network/
  src/
  res/
    train2017/
    test2017/
    val2017/
    annotations/
```

2. `cd` into `src/`
3. Run `make`
4. Run `jupyter notebook`


## To Do
1. Get the segmentation mask for each image
2. Train a basic pytorch model on the data
3. Make function to alter background of image
