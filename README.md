# Context Free Network
Exploring the effects of context in image classification


## Instructions
Download the data and add it to `res/` directory. Your directory tree should look like this:
```
context-free-network/
  src/
  res/
    train2017/
    test2017/
    val2017/
    annotations/
```

cd into `src/`
run `make`
run `jupyter notebook`


## To Do
1. get the segmentation mask for each image
2. train a basic pytorch model on the data
3. make function to alter background of image
